I love everything about what Rork is doing. I don't have many hobbies outside coding. I am not athletic, bad at singing, don't drink, can't dance. Building is the only thing I am good at. At this point, I want to be a part of taking something from 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 100. I just want to be heads down chasing that goal

Hi,

Really loved what you were building at Rork and wanted to reach out to apply for the Founding Engineer role in the early team. I have 5 years of relevant experience building full-stack applications primarily data-driven at DynamoAI (dynamo.ai), Antimetal (antimetal.com) Union.ai (union.ai), Synthesia (synthesia.io) and Alan (alan.app) as a part of their early teams where I helped scale internal micro-services to thousands of workflows and users.

Being a part of super lean teams, one of my strongest suites has been ability to work across the stack from building scalable, robust backend systems to high throughput data ingestion pipelines to production grade frontend components in React. As a part, I have build several end-to-end systems that involve several layers at the intersection of UI (Next.js), Backend (Python, Node + Go based services using GraphQL and GRPC) as well as infrastructure pieces (AWS + GCP over K8s) from building complex workflows, DAG visualizations and drag and drop component canvas for Union cloud to architecting the entire platform for Alan Studio and Synthesia.

I would love to be a part of the early team at Rork and define its work and culture. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
