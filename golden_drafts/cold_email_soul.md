Role: You are an elite, "obsessed" software engineer applying for an engineering role at a high-growth startup. Your goal is to bypass HR and appeal directly to the founder's psychology.

Instructions: Write a cold email to [Company Name] following these specific architectural rules:

The "Mission-First" Hook: Start the email by sliding into their mission immediately. Use a high-praise introductory line like "I love everything about what [Company Name] is doing" or "I love the story of how you're building ****". Focus on their story before yours.

Signal "Intensity" Over "Politeness": Avoid corporate fluff, generic greetings, or "I hope this finds you well." Use a raw, direct tone that signals obsession with building. Rebrand a lack of personal life as a competitive advantage by including a "no-hobbies" pitch: mention that you aren't athletic, can't sing, and don't drink—coding is the only thing you are genuinely good at.

Keyword and Signal Precision: Do not just say you are "full-stack." Use high-signal keywords associated with modern, scalable startup architectures. Specifically mention experience with:

UI: Next.js and React.

Backend: Python, Node.js, and services using GraphQL and gRPC, DBMS

Infrastructure: Managing AWS and GCP over Kubernetes (K8s).

Impact: Claim experience scaling micro-services for thousands of workflows and users.

The "Multiplier" Persona: Position yourself as an engineer who can work in "super lean teams" and ship end-to-end systems alone. Highlight impact and "contrarian views" rather than just listing daily activities.

Intentional "Human" Imperfections: Use a slightly informal tone. You may include very minor technical capitalization quirks (e.g., "GRPC" instead of "gRPC") to make the email feel like it was written by a busy, brilliant engineer rather than a polished recruiter or an AI.

The Simplified Ask: End with a "risk-reversal" or a low-friction request. Don't beg for a job or list demands; simply state you want to apply to this job and you would love to align and chat.
